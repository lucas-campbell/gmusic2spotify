current state:
    add_tracks_to_lib not working becasue of a weird json response error. Not
    worth worrying about?
Next:
    1. attempt to build a list of track objects from playlist, make sure that has
        the same length as the storeIds list. 
    2. from a list of Track objects, create corresponding spotify playlist:
        a. for each track object, do custom search & for now just add to PL if
            there exists an exact match.
        b. Log success & failure (num tracks succeeded, name of tracks that
            didnt)
