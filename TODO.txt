current state:
    add_tracks_to_lib not working becasue of a weird json response error. Not
    worth worrying about?
Next:
    1. attempt to build a list of track objects from playlist, make sure that has
        the same length as the storeIds list. 
    2. from a list of Track objects, create corresponding spotify playlist:
        a. for each track object, do custom search & for now just add to PL if
            there exists an exact match.
        b. Log success & failure (num tracks succeeded, name of tracks that
            didnt)

Future:
    1. Have multiple Track object constructor options: one for each music
    service API so can make a call like 
    'song = Track.Track(track_dict, service= gm)'
    plus a generic one where can fill in parameters manually, e.g.
    'song = Track.Track(title='Love is All', Artist="The Tallest Man on Earth,
            ms=123456, Album='etc etc....)
    for cleaner code. Also expands the Track object fields so that can create
    algo to compare search results and put importance on one parameter or
    another  (e.g. Artist+Title > album > milliseconds > genre, etc).
